                                       <p>Early-stage ransomware investigations often hinge on the first minutes after execution, yet most empirical studies aggregate multi-hour traces or analyze single hosts in isolation. This paper presents a reproducible dataset and an analysis of ransomware behavior in Active Directory (AD) environments during these critical stages. Using a controlled AD testbed, we executed over one hundred samples from eight families -
                                        Akira, BlackMatter, BlackCat, Black Basta, Conti, DarkSide, LockBit and MedusaLocker, and collected approximately 341,000 labeled Windows Event Log entries across both victim and server (Domain Controller) roles.</p>

                                       <p>
                                        In malware clustering, outliers may be found while dismissed as noise, while they may in fact represent emerging threats, mislabeled samples, or structurally unique binaries.
                                        In this study, we systematically analyze the nature of outliers produced by two threat intelligence analytics, namely K-Means Least Trimmed Squares (LTS) and HDBSCAN, across two datasets: MOTIF, a small, well-labeled malware dataset, 
                                        and a subset (ransomware samples only) of SOREL-20M, a larger, noisier malware corpus. For reasons we will explain, clustering is performed using only DLL imports as feature vectors. Antivirus (AV) labels are used post hoc to help characterize and interpret outliers.
                                        Our results show that outliers help reveal novel or mislabeled threats. Using MOTIF, HDBSCAN flagged 61.5\% of the samples as noise, while K-Means LTS flagged only 9.9\%. Using SOREL, both methods flagged fewer relative outliers, but still revealed distinct patterns. An analysis of function counts and malware families revealed that outliers often contain either unusually sparse or overly dense API usage. The overlap between K-Means LTS and HDBSCAN outliers remained modest, highlighting the value of combining approaches.
                                        This work contributes a structured methodology to analyze clustering outliers in malware datasets and demonstrates their potential utility for malware triage, variant discovery, and optimization of the detection pipeline. 
                                        The results demonstrate how unsupervised clustering outputs can augment threat hunting and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) worksflows.

                                       <p>In recent years, the explosion of malware and extensive code reuse have formed complex evolutionary connections among malware specimens. The rapid pace of development makes it challenging for existing studies to characterize recent evolutionary trends. 
                                        In addition, intuitive tools to untangle these intricate connections between malware specimens or 
                                        categories are urgently needed. This paper introduces a manually-reviewed malware source code dataset containing 6032 specimens. Building on and extending current research from a software engineering perspective, we systematically evaluate the scale, 
                                        development costs, code quality, as well as security and dependencies of modern malware. We further introduce a multi-view genealogy analysis to clarify malware connections: at an overall view, this analysis quantifies the strength and direction of connections 
                                        among specimens and categories; at a detailed view, it traces the evolutionary histories of individual specimens. Experimental results indicate that, despite persistent shortcomings in code quality, malware specimens exhibit an increasing complexity and standardization, in step with the development of mainstream software engineering practices. Meanwhile, our genealogy analysis intuitively reveals lineage expansion and evolution driven by code reuse, providing new evidence and tools for understanding the formation and evolution of the malware ecosystem.</p>

                                    <p>Ransomware continues to be a pervasive cybersecurity threat, particularly in enterprise environments that leverage Active Directory (AD) for centralized management.
                                        This study focuses on analyzing ransomware behavior by examining Windows Event Logs generated during attacks from four prominent ransomware families: “BlackMatter,” “Conti,”, “LockBit,” and “Midnight”1. We conducted experiments on 20
                                        ransomware samples (5 per family) within a controlled Proxmox-
                                        based virtual AD environment to simulate realistic enterprise
                                        conditions. Our analysis applies n-gram sequence modeling and
                                        behavioral feature extraction to uncover distinctive event patterns
                                        and attack paths. The findings reveal consistent, family-specific
                                        behavioral sequences, such as repetitive service control and
                                        credential validation events, that are indicative of ransomware
                                        activity. In addition to offering insight into the operational
                                        methods of ransomware, we lay the groundwork for automated
                                        behavior-based detection mechanisms suited for enterprise AD
                                        environments.</p>

                                       <p>This research presents an innovative approach to enhancing ransomware detection by leveraging Windows
                                        API calls and PE header information to develop precise signatures capable of identifying ransomware families.
                                        Our methodology introduces a novel application of hierarchical clustering using the HDBSCAN algorithm,
                                        in conjunction with the Jaccard similarity metric, to cluster ransomware into discrete families and generate
                                        corresponding signatures. This technique, to our knowledge, marks a pioneering effort in applying hierarchical
                                        density-based clustering to over 1.1 million malicious samples, specifically focusing on ransomware and using
                                        the clusters to automatically generate signatures.
                                        We show that identifying unique Windows API function patterns within these clusters enables the differenti-
                                        ation and characterization of various ransomware families. Furthermore, we conducted a case study focusing
                                        on the distinctive function combinations within prominent ransomware families such as GandCrab, WannaCry,
                                        Cerber, Gotango, and CryptXXX, unveiling unique behaviors and API function usage patterns. Our scalable
                                        implementation demonstrates the ability to efficiently cluster large volumes of malicious files and automatically
                                        generate robust, actionable function signatures for each. Validation of these signatures on an independent
                                        malware dataset yielded a precision rate of 98.34% and specificity rate of 99.72%, affirming their effectiveness
                                        in detecting known ransomware families with minimal error. These findings underscore the potential of our
                                        methodology in bolstering cybersecurity defenses against the evolving landscape of ransomware threats.</p>

                                        malware labels of the same family across time. This analysis will allow signature-based

                                        and ultimately identify the variants as modifications of a core malware sample.
                                        
                                        The Sophos-ReversingLabs 20 Million dataset(SoReL-20M) is used for this re-
                                        search. [2] The SoReL-20M is a large-scale dataset consisting of nearly 20 million files
                                        
                                        with pre-extracted features, metadata, and scan reports from AV vendors. The SoReL
                                        dataset is balanced, with roughly half of the files malicious and the other half benign.
                                        The AV class scanner is used to identify all samples from a given malware samples.
                                        [3]. We first convert the malware samples to feature vectors in EMBER format. The
                                        vectors are normalized and PCA is used to reduce dimensionality. We calculate the
                                        similarities between the malware samples in a family by calculating the Euclidean
                                        distance between each pair. We then find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the
                                        similarity matrix. This produces a sequence connecting the most similar malware
                                        samples in the family.
                                        Our primary results showed that the SoReL dataset has major clusters that belonged
                                        to the Trojan malware family. There were clusters that corresponded to the Ransom
                                        Trojan and Downloader Trojan malware families. Our future work includes further
                                        analysis of patterns we might observe in the similarity matrix.</p>

                                    <p> Accurate labeling is important for detecting malware and building reference datasets
                                        which can be used for evaluating machine learning (ML) based malware classification
                                        and clustering approaches. Labels obtained from Anti-Virus (AV) vendors (such as
                                        Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, and McAfee) are one source of information; however, despite
                                        ongoing research efforts there is still inconsistency with the labeling across AV vendors
                                        [7, 5, 9]. AV vendors use differing formats and naming conventions when reporting
                                        labels of malware samples, and the reported labels between any two vendors can
                                        disagree. We address this problem in our work utilizing CP-APR, a powerful tensor
                                        decomposition method for unsupervised ML, to discover the hidden patterns across AV
                                        vendors in the way they report the malware labels. In comparison to the traditional ML
                                        methods, tensor decomposition models the multi-dimensional properties of the data
                                        and produces interpretable results [6]. The higher-dimensional representation of the
                                        AV scans enables the discovery of multi-faceted and complex details of those scans.</p>

                                            Speaker · Lightning Talk accepted for WiCyS 2026<br>
                                            <strong>Venue:</strong> WiCyS 2026 · <strong>Date:</strong> March 2026<br><br>
                                            The decision to pursue a PhD in cybersecurity or computer science is often framed as the pinnacle of academic achievement, but the realities of doctoral study are rarely discussed openly. While a PhD can lead to opportunities in research, academia, and thought leadership, it also requires navigating challenges that are not always obvious at the start.
                                            This lightning talk will take a candid look at the PhD experience and highlight what aspiring doctoral students should be prepared for before committing. Drawing from personal experience, it will touch on the dependence on research funding and how it shapes the direction of your work, the intense focus required to stay motivated through years of study, and the growing role of artificial intelligence in research, raising questions about how doctoral training might evolve. The talk will also contrast the relative benefits of a Master’s degree, which often provides faster and more flexible returns.
                                            Attendees who are considering doctoral study will leave with an honest perspective on what to expect, what challenges to prepare for, and how to decide if this path aligns with their long term goals.

                            <p>Ransomware continues to be a pervasive cybersecurity threat, particularly in enterprise environments that leverage Active Directory (AD) for centralized management.
                                This study focuses on analyzing ransomware behavior by examining Windows Event Logs generated during attacks from four prominent ransomware families: “BlackMatter,” “Conti,”, “LockBit,” and “Midnight”1. We conducted experiments on 20
                                ransomware samples (5 per family) within a controlled Proxmox-
                                based virtual AD environment to simulate realistic enterprise
                                conditions. Our analysis applies n-gram sequence modeling and
                                behavioral feature extraction to uncover distinctive event patterns
                                and attack paths. The findings reveal consistent, family-specific
                                behavioral sequences, such as repetitive service control and
                                credential validation events, that are indicative of ransomware
                                activity. In addition to offering insight into the operational
                                methods of ransomware, we lay the groundwork for automated
                                behavior-based detection mechanisms suited for enterprise AD
                                environments.</p>

                               <p>This research presents an innovative approach to enhancing ransomware detection by leveraging Windows
                                API calls and PE header information to develop precise signatures capable of identifying ransomware families.
                                Our methodology introduces a novel application of hierarchical clustering using the HDBSCAN algorithm,
                                in conjunction with the Jaccard similarity metric, to cluster ransomware into discrete families and generate
                                corresponding signatures. This technique, to our knowledge, marks a pioneering effort in applying hierarchical
                                density-based clustering to over 1.1 million malicious samples, specifically focusing on ransomware and using
                                the clusters to automatically generate signatures.
                                We show that identifying unique Windows API function patterns within these clusters enables the differenti-
                                ation and characterization of various ransomware families. Furthermore, we conducted a case study focusing
                                on the distinctive function combinations within prominent ransomware families such as GandCrab, WannaCry,
                                Cerber, Gotango, and CryptXXX, unveiling unique behaviors and API function usage patterns. Our scalable
                                implementation demonstrates the ability to efficiently cluster large volumes of malicious files and automatically
                                generate robust, actionable function signatures for each. Validation of these signatures on an independent
                                malware dataset yielded a precision rate of 98.34% and specificity rate of 99.72%, affirming their effectiveness
                                in detecting known ransomware families with minimal error. These findings underscore the potential of our
                                methodology in bolstering cybersecurity defenses against the evolving landscape of ransomware threats.</p>

                                <p>We analyze the handshake protocol of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, version 1.3. We address both the full TLS 1.3 handshake (the one round-trip time mode, with signatures for authentication and (elliptic curve) 
                                Diffie–Hellman ephemeral ((EC)DHE) key exchange), and the abbreviated resumption/“PSK” mode which uses a pre-shared key for authentication (with optional (EC)DHE key exchange and zero round-trip time key establishment). Our analysis in the reductionist security framework uses a multi-stage key exchange 
                                security model, where each of the many session keys derived in a single TLS 1.3 handshake is tagged with various properties (such as unauthenticated versus unilaterally authenticated versus mutually authenticated, whether it is intended to provide forward security, how it is used in the protocol, and whether the key is protected against replay attacks). 
                                We show that these TLS 1.3 handshake protocol modes establish session keys with their desired security properties under standard cryptographic assumptions.</p>

                               <p>We propose the use of clustering to analyse similar and differing features between
                                malware labels of the same family across time. This analysis will allow signature-based
                                detection methods to check for key differences between existing malware and its variants
                                and ultimately identify the variants as modifications of a core malware sample.
                                
                                The Sophos-ReversingLabs 20 Million dataset(SoReL-20M) is used for this re-
                                search. [2] The SoReL-20M is a large-scale dataset consisting of nearly 20 million files
                                
                                with pre-extracted features, metadata, and scan reports from AV vendors. The SoReL
                                dataset is balanced, with roughly half of the files malicious and the other half benign.
                                The AV class scanner is used to identify all samples from a given malware samples.
                                [3]. We first convert the malware samples to feature vectors in EMBER format. The
                                vectors are normalized and PCA is used to reduce dimensionality. We calculate the
                                similarities between the malware samples in a family by calculating the Euclidean
                                distance between each pair. We then find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the
                                similarity matrix. This produces a sequence connecting the most similar malware
                                samples in the family.
                                Our primary results showed that the SoReL dataset has major clusters that belonged
                                to the Trojan malware family. There were clusters that corresponded to the Ransom
                                Trojan and Downloader Trojan malware families. Our future work includes further
                                analysis of patterns we might observe in the similarity matrix.</p>

                            <p> Accurate labeling is important for detecting malware and building reference datasets
                                which can be used for evaluating machine learning (ML) based malware classification
                                and clustering approaches. Labels obtained from Anti-Virus (AV) vendors (such as
                                Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, and McAfee) are one source of information; however, despite
                                ongoing research efforts there is still inconsistency with the labeling across AV vendors
                                [7, 5, 9]. AV vendors use differing formats and naming conventions when reporting
                                labels of malware samples, and the reported labels between any two vendors can
                                disagree. We address this problem in our work utilizing CP-APR, a powerful tensor
                                decomposition method for unsupervised ML, to discover the hidden patterns across AV
                                vendors in the way they report the malware labels. In comparison to the traditional ML
                                methods, tensor decomposition models the multi-dimensional properties of the data
                                and produces interpretable results [6]. The higher-dimensional representation of the
                                AV scans enables the discovery of multi-faceted and complex details of those scans.</p>

        <h2 id="about-title">About</h2>
        <p>I’m a CS Ph.D. candidate at UMBC researching ransomware detection in Active Directory with behavior‑based analysis and machine learning. I’ve taught ML, Networks, Reverse Engineering, and AI for ~6 years, and worked with IBM’s CISO team, Navy Federal (Automation), and Palo Alto Networks (Threat Intel). I care about practical security and explainable methods.</p>

            <h4>Life Goal</h4>
            <p>My name reflects both "wisdom" and the "knowledge of nothingness", which speaks to my lifelong pursuit of understanding the world while embracing the endless possibilities of the unknown — both in life and in the realm of cybersecurity threats.</p>

          <article class="about-card">
            <h4>Career Interest</h4>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), with a focus on cybersecurity, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My growing expertise lies in the cybersecurity domain, where I have conducted research in cryptography, malware analysis, and AI‑driven solutions. Each day, I strive to deepen my knowledge and contribute to innovations in these fields.</p>

          <article class="about-card">
            <h4>Work Experience</h4>
            <p>With nearly six years of experience as a Teaching Assistant, I’ve had the opportunity to instruct courses such as Introduction to Machine Learning, Computer Networks, Software Reverse Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and more. This role has honed my ability to break down complex concepts and share my passion for computer science. Alongside my academic experience, I have four years of professional industry experience, having worked with the CISO team at IBM, the Projects Automation team at Navy Federal Credit Union, and as a Threat Intelligence Researcher for Cybercrime at Palo Alto Networks.</p>

  <!-- HOBBIES -->
  <section id="hobbies" class="hobbies container" aria-labelledby="hobbies-title">
    <h2 id="hobbies-title">Beyond the Code: My Hobbies</h2>
    <div>
      <p>When I'm not diving into the world of cybersecurity or exploring new tech frontiers, you'll probably find me immersed in something just as exciting.</p>
      <p>Whether it's mastering stealth in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> on my PS5 or getting lost in the beauty of nature while hiking, I'm always up for a new adventure. Cooking up a storm in the kitchen, binge-watching the latest TV shows, or jamming out to my favorite music are my go-to ways to unwind.</p>
      <p>Art in all its forms fascinates me. I love learning about different art styles, getting inspired by creative expression, and even hitting the dance floor when the rhythm calls for it. Life, after all, is about balance — and I make sure to find mine between tech, art, and a bit of adventure.</p>

            Welcome to my professional portfolio (or maybe not so professional!).</h1>

            <h5> Life Goal</h5>  
            <img src="images/Prajna_grad_photo.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
          
        <p> My name reflects both "wisdom" and the "knowledge of nothingness," which speaks to my 
        lifelong pursuit of understanding the world while embracing the endless possibilities of the unknown - both in life and in the realm of cybersecurity threats.</p> 
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in 
            Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), with a focus on cybersecurity, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 
            My growing expertise lies in the cybersecurity domain, where I have conducted research in cryptography, malware analysis, and AI-driven solutions. 
            Each day, I strive to deepen my knowledge and contribute to innovations in these fields.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>With nearly six years of experience as a Teaching Assistant, 
                I’ve had the opportunity to instruct courses such as Introduction to Machine Learning, Computer Networks, Software Reverse Engineering, 
                Artificial Intelligence, and more. This role has honed my ability to break down complex concepts and share my passion for computer science. 
                Alongside my academic experience, I have four years of professional industry experience, having worked with the CISO team at IBM, the Projects 
                Automation team at Navy Federal Credit Union, and as a Threat Intelligence Researcher for Cybercrime at Palo Alto Networks.</p> 
            </div>
            <div>   
                <p>I am driven by an insatiable curiosity and a hunger for knowledge — never content with mastering just one field. While I embrace the 
                    “jack of all trades” mentality, I continually strive to refine my skills across diverse domains, ensuring I can offer the very best in whatever I do.</p> </section>

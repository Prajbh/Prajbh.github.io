    <h2>Beyond the Code: My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I'm not diving into cybersecurity or exploring new tech frontiers, you'll probably find me immersed in something just as exciting.</p>
    <p>Whether it's mastering stealth in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> on my PS5 or hiking in nature, I'm always up for adventure. Cooking, binge-watching shows, or jamming to music help me unwind. I love learning about different art styles, finding inspiration in creativity, and even dancing when the rhythm calls.</p>

      <p>Whether it's mastering stealth in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> on my PS5 or getting lost in the beauty of nature while hiking, I'm always up for a new adventure. Cooking up a storm in the kitchen, binge-watching the latest TV shows, or jamming out to my favorite music are my go-to ways to unwind.</p>
      <p>Art in all its forms fascinates me. I love learning about different art styles, getting inspired by creative expression, and even hitting the dance floor when the rhythm calls for it. Life, after all, is about balance—and I make sure to find mine between tech, art, and a bit of adventure.</p>

                  <p>It was the day I was supposed to return back to Baltimore to begin my 5th semester in PhD after having had an amazing opportunity 
                     to work as a cybersecurity specialist intern for IBM CISO. I had charged my phone to 100% before leaving my airbnb but I perhaps used it
                     too much to spend my 6 hour wait at the airport for the flight which was delayed. I decided I will not use my phone for the three and a half journey left 
                     on the flight as I need to save power to book a cab to home. There were no charging ports available on this flight. <br>
                     I tried closing my eyes and getting some sleep for the first hour of the flight but then I felt my seat being forfully pushed forward. I turn back to see what was wrong with the seat to only find the little kid
                     start crying over something he wanted hsi mother to do for him. I chose to keep quite thinking he will calm down in another 10 minutes like kids normally would. But there was nothing stopping this kid from constantly crying 
                     out loud in a voice frequency that hurt my ear drums. I tried closing my ears tight with my hands but that voice was pretty powerful. The very kind sweet lady who looked like she might have been in her early 60s turns towards
                     and asks "Do you not like kids?". I replied to her saying, "Well, I love kids but not this one!". We both had a chuckle.<br>
                     We then continued our conversation introducing ourselves and quickly found out that we are pretty similar and have many thoughts inn common about things in general. She told me she is currently in a new venture of authoring books. Her first book was published recently
                     titled "You first, me second". I spoke to her about my passion to work in the cybersecurity field and how I would love to try my hand at acting someday becasue I feel I am talented at that.<br>
                     We spend the next two hours sharing our views on spirituality and humanity. I told her about how as I am being blessed with a comfortable life, I want to share and give back as much as I can as well. She shared how she was able to impact a few lives herself by being able to help others 
                     via her charity. We exchanged emails at the end.<br>
                     It had been long since I had such an meaningful conversation with a stranger. I was very inspired by her life story. There were so many things I was able to learn about life and how I would want to live it. That is something I always try to learn from my conversations with people. I beleive 
                     every indivisual has a unique personality. I always beleive two people can be similar but they are nnever the same. I was so inspired by her that I wanted to immediately go buy her book. We got out of our flight and bid our goodbyes. She had another flight to catch. Later after I reached home a very unexpected thing happened.
                     I had a notification of email on my phone so I opened it up and the words I read gave me a feeling of blissful happiness. A feeling I've perhaps rarely felt reading a email before.<br>
                     The email read "I wanted you to know that our earlier conversation on the plane was a true delight for me as we shared so many common interests!  You are a beautifully gifted young lady with an incredibly dynamic personality! I hope you’ve made it home safely and found your place to be in order!  I’m awaiting my final connecting 
                     flight to get me home but your words of encouragement have given me renewed energy!  Let's stay in touch! " Here is a proof that words are very powerful and generates emotions in a person so you should be very careful with the words you chose to speak. I immediately ordered her book.<br>
                     It took me sometime to finsih the book as I had a lot of work going on juggling between things. But I finally finished it. It was a beutiful collection of real stories that the author wanted to share. Each story had a emphasis on how being slefless and helping others helps make this world a very beautiful place to live in.
                     I shared my thoughts on the book to her and she replied back with more encouraging words. Life does tend to get busy at times, I hope I can keep in touch with her in the classic old style of exchanging emails. I maybe now want to try mailing letters to someone someday. It seems fun!  </p>

                  <p> It just happened! <br>
                     It was a very unprecedented time when there was a high possibility that all companies might have to go remote for a few more months. There was a 
                     hiring freeze in most companies and lay-offs in others. Tough time for all students. I always wanted to do PhD so I took my chance and asked my advisor 
                     about the possibility of me coming back to the university maybe after two years of experience for a PhD degree. He advised me to apply for PhD right away if I wish 
                     to do one. He advised me if I wanted to really do PhD thenn why not do it right away and continue my studies. <br>
                     After thinking for sometime, I decided that given the current situation in the job market, I might as well take up PhD right now.<br>
                     And so it just happened because I was in the right place at the right time!
